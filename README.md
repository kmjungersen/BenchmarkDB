# Database Benchmarking

This application is intended to help you benchmark a database of your choice very simply and easily.  Simply follow the specified steps to build a module of your own and then you can see how it stacks up to other similar databases!

The following modules are currently operational:
* Riak 1.x DB
* Riak 2.0 DB
* Riak 2.0 DB with highly consistent buckets
* MongoDB (Sharded replication set)
* PostgreSQL (semi-sharded cluster - see module [README](postgreSQLdb/README.md)) (NEW!)

## Sample Reports

These reports have already been generated by the developer (your's truly...):
Recently updated with graphs:
* [Riak 1.x DB - 3000 reads/writes](published_reports/riakdb/RIAK-standard-3000trials/RIAK-standard-3000trials.md)

## Some Nice Features

Some sweet features of using this robust application as opposed to hacking together a quick benchmark
* Robust Data Analysis with PANDAS allows you to handle any ludacris number of benchmark trials (I've tried up to 100k)
* MatPlotLib graphs of data so you can see what really matters
* Ansible roles for each module, enabling local or remote deployment and testing
* Easily modify IP and port addresses to run benchmarks on remote deployments, especially your development and production servers 
* Track benchmark progress with the progress bar, while optional verbose output gives you more detailed info on what's going on
* Generate a markdown report to view in a nicely formatted document for showing off to your boss or whomever
* `Invoke` tasks simplify most common tasks for basic usage.
    ```
    invoke help
    ```
    displays the following:
    
    ```
      benchmark             Executes benchmarks with the default settings for a
                            given DB
      deploy                Runs the ansible playbook for a given db
      help                  Returns some basic task information, much of which
                            provided by invoke
      install_ssh_copy_id   Installs ssh_copy_id for mac
      list_mods             Returns a list of existing modules
      requirements          Pip installs all requirements
      vagrant_up            Runs `vagrant up` for the specified module
    ```

## Using the Application

1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.  It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ``` bash
    $ cd <path_to_project>/BenchmarkDB
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Deploy the DB
   This procedure is slightly different for every module, so be sure to read the `README` for each one.  Unless you're using one that's already deployed, then update `local.py` for the intended module to reflect the correct IP's

3. Run the app!

    ```
    $ python main.py <database_module_name> [options]
    ```
    
    Examples:
    
    ``` bash
    # Benchmark 3000 reads and writes of mongo separately, with randomly ordered reads
    $ python main.py mongodb -c --split --trials=3000
    
    # Benchmark Riak 2.0 with 10000 reads and writes, each with two 1000 character fields, 
    # and then generate a CSV file of the raw data
    $ python main.py riak2db --csv --trials=10000 --length=1000
    
    # Run the application in debug mode, which generates a Normal (Gaussian) data set for 
    # analysis and debugging
    $ python main.py --debug
    ```

    * General usage information and options, which can be viewed any time with `$ python main.py -h`:
    ``` bash
    Usage:
        main.py <database> [options]
        main.py --debug [options]
        main.py <database> <report_title> [options]

    Options:
        -h --help           Show this help screen
        -v                  Show verbose output from the application
        -V                  Show REALLY verbose output, including the time
                                from each run
        -s                  Sleep mode (experimental) - sleeps for 1/20 (s)
                                between each read and write

        -c --chaos          Activates CHAOS mode, where reads are taken
                                randomly from the DB instead of sequentially
        -l --list           Outputs a list of available DB modules

        --csv               Records unaltered read and write data to a CSV file
                                for your own analysis
        --no-report         Option to disable the creation of the report file
        --split             Splits reads and writes into two consecutive
                                batches instead of alternating between them
        --debug             Generates a random dataset instead of actually
                                connecting to a DB

        --length=<n>        Specify an entry length for reads/writes
                                [default: 10]
        --trials=<n>        Specify the number of reads and writes to make to
                                the DB to collect data on [default: 1000]
    ```

## Building a module

If you want to benchmark a DB that isn't already included, build a new module!  Fork the project from dev before making your changes, and then follow the instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md` to create a new module to use with this application!

Building a new module is extremely easy, so please do so and then submit a PR to share that module with everyone else!
